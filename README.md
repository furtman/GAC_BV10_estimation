# GAC_BV10_estimation
This repository contains a web app to predict early micropollutant breakthroughs and a database of micropollutant breakthroughs in granular activated carbon (GAC). These materials were developed as a part of a research project that was supported in part by the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences Superfund Research Program (1P42ES031009-01), the North Carolina Policy Collaborative through an appropriation from the North Carolina General Assembly, and North Carolina State University.
Please note that the web app raw codes and the database included in this repository have different licenses.
